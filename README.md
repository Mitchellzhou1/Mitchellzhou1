## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m **Mitchell Zhou**, a **graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University** majoring in **Information Security**.  
I’m passionate about **offensive security** — to me, it’s the closest thing to *computer magic*: understanding systems so deeply that you can make them do what they were never intended to.

I love exploring how complex software and infrastructure can be broken, fixed, and hardened.  
My learning revolves around **CTFs**, **CVE research**, **labs**, and **hands-on security projects** that bridge theory with real-world impact.  
Whether it’s reverse engineering a binary, analyzing a vulnerability, or simulating attacks in a lab, I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to make technology more secure.
